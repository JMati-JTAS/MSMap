# Building the samples

The `SampleBuilder.exe` (x64) will combine the 'Samples' and 'Static' folders and generates  the start page and the samples.json files.

The source code of the `SampleBuilder.exe` can be in the [Azure Maps Samples GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureMapsCodeSamples) page.
